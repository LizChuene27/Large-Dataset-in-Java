This capstone is a dataset containing a list of employees in a company. Each employee object has attributes such as name, age, department, and salary. 
What the project entails: A program that reads the dataset and stores it in a collection.
A function using the Function interface that takes an employee object as input and returns the employee's name and department as a concatenated string.
Using streams, I generated a new collection that contains the concatenated strings obtained from the previous step.
The program finds the average salary of all employees using the stream's built-in functions.
I incorporated a filter function that only includes employees whose age is above a certain threshold (e.g., 30 years).
